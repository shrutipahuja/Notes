# Notes
This little application can be used to take down notes and store them in memory from where they can be easily accessed.

A note has a title, content and is stamped with the current date and time.

Notes has three screens:

Screen 1: Notes List Screen

This screen displays the notes created in a reverse chronological order where the latest note is displayed first. Each note has the title, content and the timestamp.

A FAB can be clicked on to create a new note, which takes the user to the Create Note Screen.

Screen 2: Create Note Screen
