# Notes
This little application can be used to take down notes and store them in memory from where they can be easily accessed.

A note has a title, content and is stamped with the current date and time.

Notes has three screens:

Screen 1: Notes List Screen

This screen displays the notes created in a reverse chronological order where the latest note is displayed first. Each note has the title, content and the timestamp.

A FAB can be clicked on to create a new note, which takes the user to the Create Note Screen.

When any note is clicked, the user is redirected to the Note Details Screen.

Screen 2: Create Note Screen

This screen can be used to create a new note with title and content. Neither the title nor content can be blank. On clicking the save button, the note is saved to memory. The user is then redirected to the Note Details Screen.

Screen 3: Note Details Screen
<img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60269503/74525414-0eee6c00-4f47-11ea-8848-51786e924c82.png" width = "200" height = "400"/>
This screen is launched either when the user creates a new note and saves it or on clicking on the note from the Notes List screen.

This is a static screen which displays the note title, note content and the time stamp when the note was created.
